	 * If the compiler erases all type parameters at compile time, 
	 * why should you use generics?
	 * 
	 * Answer: You should use generics because:
	 * 			- The Java compiler enforces tighter checkas on generic code at compile time.
	 * 			- Generics support programming types as parameters.
	 * 			- Generics enable you to implement generic algorithms.
